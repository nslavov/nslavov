## Research
[My laboratory](https://slavovlab.net/) aims to understand the rules governing emergent systems-level behavior and to use these rules to rationally engineer biological systems. We make quantitative measurements, often at the single-cell level, to test different conceptual frameworks and discriminate among different classes of models. 
Areas of focus include:
*  [Translational control of protein synthesis:](https://slavovlab.net/research.htm#Ribosome-Specialization) Mechanisms by which ribosomal modifications regulate protein synthesis 
* [Single-cell protein analysis:](https://scp.slavovlab.net) We develop and apply mass-spectrometry methods that allow analyzing thousands of proteins in single cells. These data have enabled characterizing post-transcriptional regulation in single cells at systems level, as well as discovering macrophage polarization in the absence of polarizing cytokines.

## Background 
I received a BS from MIT in 2004 and then pursued doctoral research in the Botstein laboratory at Princeton University, aiming to understand how cells coordinate their growth, gene expression, and metabolism. As a postdoc in the van Oudenaarden laboratory at MIT, I characterized trade-offs of aerobic glycolysis (also known as Warburg effect) and obtained direct evidence for differential stoichiometry among core ribosomal proteins, suggesting that specialized ribosomes regulate protein synthesis.
